        <p class="lead mt-4">
            Costs to Expect is a service which primarily focuses on the tracking
            and forecasting of expenses; it grew from an offhand comment I made
            to my wife before we had our first child,
            <em>"There is no way the average child costs Â£250,000 to raise!"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Medium-term the service will not be limited to expenses, the project
            grew from a personal expenses tracking project, so it makes sense to
            focus initially on expenses.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are three parts to the service, two Open Source and one soon to
            be commercial product.
